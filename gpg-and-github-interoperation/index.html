Based on various mature algorithms to select from, GPG acts as a convenient tool for daily cryptographic communication.</p><p>GPG has two primary functionalities: (1) it encrypts and signs your data for secure transfering and verifiable information integrity, and (2) it features a versatile key management system to construct and promote web of trust. GPG also has a well-designed command line interface for easy integration with other applications such as git.</p><p>This article is going to briefly elaborate some key concepts and usage of GPG, and then present demonstration to cryptographically sign git commits with the help of GPG.</p><h1 id="modern-cryptography-101">Modern Cryptography 101</h1><p>To understand how GPG or other privacy tools work, I should first introduce some basic ideas of modern cryptography. Let’s start with the two primary problems of secure communication, which includes <em>data encryption</em> and <em>data integrity/authenticity verification</em>.</p><h2 id="data-encryption">Data Encryption</h2><p>Peer-to-peer data encryption aims to prevent the message from being spied by a potential third party, especially when the two parties are communicating over a channel open to the public. Imagine Alice and Bob are mailing through pigeons, with the message unencrypted and clearly written on the paper. It is possible for a third person called Blake to intercept the pigeon, open the attached mailbox and read the message in it, without Alice and Bob knowing his existence.</p><p>Data encryption is introduced to defend against such attacks. For secure data exchange, Alice and Bob should agree on some kind of invertible message processing pipeline. The sender preprocesses (encrypts) the message before it attached to the pigeon, and the recipient performs the inverted process (decrypts) to read the clear message. In terms of cryptography, such pipeline is called a cryptographic algorithm or a <em>cipher</em>.</p><p>A cipher usually works with a key (or several keys). With the cipher fixed, the message encrypted with one key should only be decrypted with the same one. Modern ciphers are carefully designed to satisfy that Blake is hard to perform decryption without the key, even if he knows the full detail of the cipher. Under this assurance, Alice and Bob only have to choose a specific algorithm as cipher from the public list, and agree on the key before communication. This simplifies the process of negotiation, as they don’t have to discuss the sophisticated implementation of the cipher.</p><p>The currently available ciphers can be roughly categorized into two families, the <em>symmetric ciphers</em> and the <em>public-key ciphers</em>.</p><h2 id="symmetric-ciphers">Symmetric Ciphers</h2><p>Symmetric ciphers encrypt and decrypt messages using the same key. They went back far into human history. You might have heard of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a> that replaces each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet, which is a famous example of this category. For Caesar cipher, the key is the number of positions being shifted, like <code>3</code> for a tranformation of <code>A-&gt;D, B-&gt;E</code>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of_3.svg/330px-Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of_3.svg.png" alt=""></p><p>Symmetric cipher exposes several drawbacks in realistic usage. First, it provides no defense against the scenario of the key being stolen. If Blake somehow knows the key, he can both spy and forge the messages sent between Alice and Bob. Also, it would require $n(n-1)/2$ keys to achieve pairwise communication among $n$ persons, increasing the expense of key exchange and opportunity of leakage.</p><h2 id="public-key-ciphers">Public-key Ciphers</h2><p>By contrast, the public-key ciphers mitigate the problems by adopting a pair of keys instead of just one. A message encrypted by one key might only be decrypted with the other, and <em>vice versa</em>.</p><p>Practically we name one of them as <em>public key</em> and the other as <em>secret key</em>. The public key is published to whom we want to communicate with, while the secret key is kept locally and must only be known to ourselves. When Alice sends a message to Bob, the message is encrypted with Bob’s public key, and Bob uses his own private key to decrypt it on receiving.</p><p>Public-key ciphers reduce the adverse impact of public key leakage. An attacker with Alice’s public key in hand is unable to decrypt messages sent by others to her. Also, only $n$ keys have to be exchanged for $n$-person pairwise communication. The advantages overall result in lower key exchanging expense and inclined popularity of public-key ciphers in real life.</p><h2 id="digital-signatures-for-data-integrity">Digital Signatures for Data Integrity</h2><p>Ciphers solve the problem of data encryption, preventing the messages transfered from being spied by a third party, albeit they do not guarantee the integrity and authenticity of the data. Bob cannot tell whether the message he received is truly sent by Alice, since his public key is known by the world. Towards this purpose, the concept of <em>digital signatures</em> must be introduced.</p><p>Digital signatures employs the idea of hashing. In cryptography, hashing is a technique to generate digest for a piece of message. The digest must be almost unique, that is, two different messages should ideally have unequal value of digests. Also, it should guarantee that <em>no one</em> would recover the original plaintext from the digest <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Practically, Alice the sender would attach an encrypted digest as digital signature along with the message, by first applying a hash function and then encrypt with <em>Alice’s</em> own private key on the message. Anyone can decrypt the signature with Alice’s public key to verify that the message is truly signed by Alice and sent as-is. Since no one else knows Alice’s private key, the signature cannot be forged and hence is a mighty tool to assure authenticity.</p><h1 id="gpg">GPG</h1><p>The ciphers and digital signatures form the foundation of modern cryptography, upon which OpenPGP is proposed and GPG built as a high-level structure for convenient daily usage. This post will not explain the full details of GPG, but its basic idea and some of the frequently-used operations as tutorial.</p><p>Compared with the basic public-key system, OpenPGP further adopts a more sophisticated design. OpenPGP adopts a concept “user” to distinguish identities. A user is uniquely identified by his <em>real name</em> and <em>email</em>, and could own a primary key pair plus an optional collection of sub key pairs, each key pair with potentially different capabilities such as encryption or signing. The separation of keys’ responsibility enables one to revoke compromised keys without interfering the validity of others, leading to more flexible key management.</p><h2 id="key-generation">Key Generation</h2><p>To create a user and generate the key pair, we can use the <code>gpg --generate-key</code> command</p><div class="gk-code hljs" data-gk-id="BLOCK1"><div class="gk-code-display"><pre><span class="line">$ gpg --generate-key</span><br><span class="line">gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.19; Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</span><br><span class="line">This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.</span><br><span class="line">There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Note: Use &quot;gpg --full-generate-key&quot; for a full featured key generation dialog.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Real name: FooBar</span><br><span class="line">Email address: foobar@foobar</span><br><span class="line">You selected this USER-ID:</span><br><span class="line">    &quot;FooBar &lt;foobar@foobar&gt;&quot;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit?

While its history went back into old days and the UX might look wierd, it still stands as one of the de-facto standards in modern world. This article extensively explains the fundamental idea of modern cryptography on which GPG is based, followed with the demonstration of some GPG every-day usages, and further the instruction to integrate it with external tools/services such as Git or Github. Hopefully it will enlighten you about the approaches to carry out secure message exchange in daily life.</p><div class="footnotes"><ol><li class="footnote" id="fn:1">Even the performer of hashing cannot!
